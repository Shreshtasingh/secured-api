Here’s a sample README.md file template for your Secured API Project. You can customize it based on your specific project details.

Secured API Project
A secure API built to handle [insert purpose, e.g., user authentication, data management, etc.] with best practices for data protection, authentication, and error handling. This project is designed to demonstrate a backend service that adheres to modern security standards.

Features
🔒 Secure Authentication: Implements [JWT/OAuth2/Session-based authentication] for secure user access.
🛡️ Data Encryption: Encrypts sensitive data using [e.g., bcrypt, AES].
✅ Validation: Strong input validation to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.
📡 RESTful APIs: Follows REST standards for API design.
📂 Modular Code: Clean and scalable architecture for easy maintenance.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: [e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java]
Framework: [e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Spring Boot]
Database: [e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL]
Authentication: [e.g., JWT, OAuth2]
Other Tools: [e.g., dotenv, bcrypt, Swagger for API documentation]

Security Features
Token-Based Authentication: All sensitive routes require a valid JWT token.
Data Validation: Uses [e.g., Joi, express-validator] to validate incoming data.
Error Handling: Centralized error handling for consistent responses.
Environment Variables: Secrets and configuration are stored securely in .env.
